# rubyfmt-compliant Rubocop config.
#
# This file generally opts to simply disable cops
# instead of setting them to come kind of compliant configuration setting.
# This is to avoid having multiple tools enforcing the same thing -- rubyfmt
# can check the formatting itself using the `--check` param, so there's no need
# to also have Rubocop check those and have conflicting errors reported in the
# editor or at the command line.

# `rubyfmt` is intended to supercede any and all other formatting
# styles, so we just disable this entire group.
Format:
  Enabled: false

# `rubyfmt` always double-quotes strings
Style/StringLiterals:
  Enabled: false
